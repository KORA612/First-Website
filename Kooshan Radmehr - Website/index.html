    <h2>1. Khorasani Style</h2>
    <div class="exp">
      <p>
        The literary style of Khorasan was the style of the poets of Khorasan,
        which was used from the beginning of the 4th century to the middle of
        the 6th century. The first Persian poems were written in this style.<br />
      </p>

      <h4>Characteristics of Khorasani style :</h4>
      <p>
        1. The works of this style rely on verbal and formal adverbs and
        traditions.<br />
        2. These works have logical sequences of meanings and splendor of
        words<br />
        3. The similes of this period are often sensual and lack complexity.<br />
        4. The poems of this style are mostly odes, and in terms of vocabulary,
        they are simple, fluent, and there are few Arabic words in them.<br />
        5. In terms of meaning, tangible similes are an important feature of
        this style.<br />
        6. The works are subject-oriented.<br />
        7. Using fancy language and organizing various themes.<br />

          Abul-Qâsem Ferdowsi Tusi
        </a>
        (Persian: ابوالقاسم فردوسی توسی; 940 – 1019/1025), also Firdawsi or
        Ferdowsi (فردوسی), was a Persian poet and the author of Shahnameh ("Book
        of Kings"), which is one of the world's longest epic poems created by a
        single poet, and the greatest epic of Persian-speaking countries.
        Ferdowsi is celebrated as one of the most influential figures of Persian
        literature and one of the greatest in the history of literature.<br />Ferdowsi
        was born into a family of Iranian landowners (dehqans) in 940 in the
        village of Paj, near the city of Tus, in the Khorasan region of the
        Samanid Empire, which is located in the present-day Razavi Khorasan
        Province of northeastern Iran. Little is known about Ferdowsi's early
        life. The poet had a wife, who was probably literate and came from the
        same dehqan class. He had a son, who died at the age of 37, and was
        mourned by the poet in an elegy which he inserted into the Shahnameh.

          Hakim Abul-Majd Majdūd ibn Ādam Sanā'ī Ghaznavi
        </a>
        (Persian: حکیم ابوالمجد مجدود ‌بن آدم سنایی غزنوی), more commonly known
        as Sanai, was a Persian[2][3] poet from Ghazni who lived his life in the
        Ghaznavid Empire which is now located in Afghanistan. He was born in
        1080 and died between 1131 and 1141.<br />He wrote an enormous quantity
        of mystical verse, of which The Walled Garden of Truth or The Hadiqat al
        Haqiqa (حدیقه الحقیقه و شریعه الطریقه) is his master work and the first
        Persian mystical epic of Sufism. Dedicated to Bahram Shah, the work
        expresses the poet's ideas on God, love, philosophy and reason

      <h3>Nizami Ganjavi</h3>

          Nizami Ganjavi
        </a>
        (Persian: نظامی گنجوی, romanized: Niẓāmī Ganjavī, lit. 'Niẓāmī of
        Ganja'; c. 1141–1209), Nizami Ganje'i, Nizami, or Nezāmi, whose formal
        name was Jamal ad-Dīn Abū Muḥammad Ilyās ibn-Yūsuf ibn-Zakkī, was a
        12th-century Persian Sunni Muslim poet. Nezāmi is considered the
        greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature, who brought a
        colloquial and realistic style to the Persian epic. His heritage is
        widely appreciated and shared by Afghanistan, Republic of Azerbaijan,
        Iran, the Kurdistan region and Tajikistan.<br />His personal name was
        Ilyas and his chosen pen-name was Nezami (also spelled as Nizami and
        Neẓāmi). He was born of an urban background in Ganja (Seljuq empire, now
        Republic of Azerbaijan) and is believed to have spent his whole life in
        South Caucasus. According to De Blois, Ganja was a city which at that
        time had predominantly an Iranian population. The Armenian historian
        Kirakos Gandzaketsi (c. 1200 – 1271) mentions that: "This city was
        densely populated with Iranians and a small number of Christians".
        Because Nezami was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of
        the dynasties. Tazkerehs, which are the compilations of literary memoirs
        that include maxims of the great poets along with biographical
        information and commentary of styles refer to him briefly. Much of this
        material in these Tazkerehs are based on legends, anecdotes, and
        hearsays. Consequently, few facts are known about Nezami's life, the
        only source being his own work, which does not provide much information
        on his personal life.

    <h2>2. Iraqi Style</h2>
    <div class="exp">
      <p>
        Iraqi style refers to a style of Persian poetry that was popular and
        continued from the end of the 6th century to the 9th century of
        Hijri.<br />
        The Iraqi style was created by the success of the Seljuks in Khorasan at
        that time and the Atabakans in Iraq and Azerbaijan. At this time (sixth
        century Hijri), parts of western Iran were also called Iraq, but to
        distinguish them from the middle of the rivers, they called that place
        Arab Iraq and this place Ajam Iraq. At this time, the literary treasure
        of Iran was transferred to Ajam, Azerbaijan and Iraq. Historically, the
        Iraqi style covers the period of the Mongols, Ilkhans and Timurids and
        continues from the 7th century to the 9th century.<br />
        When the Mongols razed Khorasan to the ground, the scholars and writers
        who survived escaped to Isfahan, Shiraz, Baghdad and other areas where
        their material well-being and spiritual resources were spared from the
        Mongols' looting. As a result of the destruction of Baghdad, of course,
        the Arab influence arose and the local emirs, whether Turkish or
        Iranian, were all promoters of the Persian language and literature. The
        poetry that migrated from the ruins of Khorasan found a new homeland in
        the West and the "Iraqi style" became its manifestation.
      </p>

      <h4>Characteristics of Iraqi style :</h4>
      <p>
        1. In the Iraqi style, due to the transfer of power centers and the
        expansion of science in the fields of scientific and cultural education
        in different cities of Iran, scientific and judgmental, philosophical,
        religious and astrologic words are included in the works of poets.<br />
        2. In this style, the ode gave its place to the ghazal, and the
        simplicity, fluidity and strength gave way to the tenderness and
        abundance of beautiful similes and allusions, and the Arabic words also
        increased. At the same time, moral themes and advice took the place of
        exaggerated praise.<br />
        3. The poetic meanings in this new way are past praise, which is
        accompanied by a lot of exaggeration and humility towards Mamdouh. There
        is also satire, which is more popular than in the previous period.<br />
        4. Love, mysticism and morality are common themes in this style. Paying
        attention to the beauty of the word and the simplicity and melody in the
        sonnets. In the Iraqi style, the form of masnavi and ghazal becomes more
        important and continues until later periods.

        (Persian: جلال‌الدین محمد رومی), also known as Jalāl al-Dīn Muḥammad
        Balkhī (جلال‌الدین محمد بلخى) but more popularly known simply as Rumi
        (30 September 1207 – 17 December 1273), was a 13th-century Persian poet,
        Hanafi faqih, Islamic scholar, Maturidi theologian and Sufi mystic
        originally from Greater Khorasan in Greater Iran.<br />
        Rumi's influence transcends national borders and ethnic divisions:
        Iranians, Tajiks, Turks, Greeks, Pashtuns, other Central Asian Muslims,
        as well as Muslims of the Indian subcontinent have greatly appreciated
        his spiritual legacy for the past seven centuries. His poems have been
        widely translated into many of the world's languages and transposed into
        various formats. Rumi has been described as the "most popular poet" and
        the "best selling poet" in the United States.

        for the quality of his writings and for the depth of his social and
        moral thoughts.<br />Saadi is widely recognized as one of the greatest

        "Master" (استاد ostâd) among Persian scholars. He has been quoted in the
        Western traditions as well. Bustan has been ranked as one of the 100

          Khwāje Shams-od-Dīn Moḥammad Ḥāfeẓ-e Shīrāzī
        </a>
        (Persian: خواجه شمس‌‌الدین محمّد حافظ شیرازی), known by his pen name
        Hafez (حافظ, Ḥāfeẓ, 'the memorizer; the (safe) keeper'; 1325-1390) and
        as "Hafiz", was a Persian lyric poet, whose collected works are regarded
        by many Iranians as a pinnacle of Persian literature. His works are
        often found in the homes of people in the Persian-speaking world, who
        learn his poems by heart and use them as everyday proverbs and sayings.
        His life and poems have become the subjects of much analysis, commentary
        and interpretation, influencing post-14th century Persian writing more
        than any other Persian author.
        <br />Hafez is best known for his Divan of Hafez, a collection of his
        surviving poems probably compiled after his death. His works can be
        described as "antinomian" and with the medieval use of the term
        "theosophical"; the term "theosophy" in the 13th and 14th centuries was
        used to indicate mystical work by "authors only inspired by the holy
        books" (as distinguished from theology). Hafez primarily wrote in the
        literary genre of lyric poetry or ghazals, that is the ideal style for
        expressing the ecstasy of divine inspiration in the mystical form of
        love poems.

    <h2>3. Hindi Style</h2>
    <div class="exp">
      <p>
        The Culture and Politics of Persianin Precolonial HindustanMuzaffar
        AlamPersian has been an integral part of South Asian culture, and the
        life ofnorthern India (or Hindustan) in particular, for centuries.
        Recognizing andappreciating the marks of Persian influence, though these
        are perhaps lessvisible today than they were in, say, 1800, are
        nevertheless crucial for un-derstanding northern Indian literary and
        political culture. The same is true,if to a lesser degree, for other
        parts of India, though some regions, such asthe Deccan, were also
        considerably affected by Persian over the centuries.The period examined
        in this chapter is between the twelfth and the nine-teenth centuries,
        when Persian influence was at its apogee in northern India.Much has been
        written about this phenomenon over the years, though usu-ally within the
        framework of a straightforward narrative. Where an analysishas been
        attempted, it has usually been limited to a comparison of the fea-tures
        of the so- called Indian style or Indian usage (sabk-i Hindioristiªmal-i
        Hind)in Persian with those of the dominant Iranian style.
      </p>

      <h4>Characteristics of Hindi style :</h4>
      <p>
        1. Fantasizing to extremes.<br />
        2. The abundance of allegory and proverbs that Indian style poets use
        allegory and simile style to justify their strange claims.<br />
        3. Using colloquial words and market words in poetry.<br />
        4. Expressing personal situations and emotions related to wife, children
        and relatives.<br />
        5. Image fusion or composite and nested images.

        تبریزی, Mīrzā Muḥammad ʿalī Ṣāʾib, Azerbaijani: صائب تبریزی) was an
        Iranian poet, regarded as one of the greatest masters of a form of
        classical Persian lyric poetry characterized by rhymed couplets, known
        as the ghazal. He also established the "Indian style" (sabk-i Hind) in
        the literature of his native language, Azerbaijani Turkic, in which he
        is known to have written 17 ghazals and molammaʿs.<br />
        Saib was born in Tabriz, and educated in Isfahan and at some time around
        1626, he traveled to India, where he was received into the court of Shah
        Jahan. He stayed for a time in Kabul and in Kashmir, returning home
        after several years abroad. After his return, the emperor of Persia,
        Shah Abbas II, bestowed upon him the title King of Poets

    <h2>4. New Style</h2>
    <div class="exp">
      <p>
        Nima Yushij is considered the father of modern Persian poetry,
        introducing many techniques and forms to differentiate the modern from
        the old. Nevertheless, the credit for popularizing this new literary
        form within a country and culture solidly based on a thousand years of
        classical poetry goes to his few disciples such as Ahmad Shamlou, who
        adopted Nima's methods and tried new techniques of modern poetry. The
        transformation brought about by Nima Youshij, who freed Persian poetry
        from the fetters of prosodic measures, was a turning point in a long
        literary tradition. It broadened the perception and thinking of the
        poets that came after him. Nima offered a different understanding of the
        principles of classical poetry. His artistry was not confined to
        removing the need for a fixed-length hemistich and dispensing with the
        tradition of rhyming but focused on a broader structure and function
        based on a contemporary understanding of human and social existence. His
        aim in renovating poetry was to commit it to a "natural identity" and to
        achieve a modern discipline in the mind and linguistic performance of
        the poet.

      <h4>Characteristics of New style :</h4>
      <p>
        1. In fact, it is a type of contemporary Persian poetry that does not
        follow the weight and format of traditional and ancient Persian
        poetry.<br />
        2. It is used in Nimai, Sepid and New Wave poetry format.<br />
        3. In the new poems, a kind of mission and social and political
        responsibility towards the people and their pains and sufferings can be
        seen.<br />
        4. Nima's poem is a thoughtful, deep and philosophical poem, combined
        with deep analysis and insight. Narrative approach and dumb story.<br />
        5. Diagnosing - Jan Bakshi - has a major place.<br />
        6. Creation of new words and combinations.<br />
        7. New poetry uses all kinds of arrangements and possibilities in order
        to be able to cover the body of new thought and thought with interesting
        and attractive clothes. Therefore, norm avoidance is considered one of
        his linguistic possibilities.
